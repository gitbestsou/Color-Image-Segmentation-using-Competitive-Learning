# Color-Image-Segmentation-using-Competitive-Learning
This is a program to segment an image into different colours.
This is an octave program to segment an image into different colors.If you run the program image_seg.m,it will take 2 inputs,the file name of the image(the image file must be contained in this folder) and how many segments you want. Based on the segment numbers,the program generates only that many number of images, wherein each image,the segmented colors are shown.(At first,the actual image is shown). It uses competitive learning approach to cluster different colors. 
*You can change the number of iterations and the learning rate as you need.
